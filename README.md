Problem Solving in the Project

The problem tackled in this project was to efficiently store, retrieve, and display course information. The specific tasks included:

Loading data from a CSV file.
Inserting course data into a binary search tree.
Displaying the course list in sorted order.
Searching for a specific course and displaying its details and prerequisites.
Approach to the Problem

The approach involved leveraging the binary search tree (BST) data structure due to its efficiency in insertion, deletion, and search operations. BSTs maintain elements in a sorted manner, which makes it straightforward to display the course list in alphanumeric order.

Challenges and Overcoming Roadblocks

One of the significant challenges was ensuring that the BST was correctly constructed and balanced to maintain efficient search and insertion times. Debugging and testing the tree insertion and traversal functions were crucial. Another challenge was handling file I/O operations and parsing CSV data correctly, ensuring that the program could handle various file formats and potential data inconsistencies gracefully.

Expansion of Software Design and Development Approach

Working on this project has significantly expanded my approach to software design, particularly in terms of data structures. Understanding the importance of choosing the right data structure for a given problem can vastly improve the efficiency and readability of the code. The experience reinforced the value of planning and structuring data before diving into implementation, ensuring that the chosen data structure aligns with the problem requirements.

Evolution in Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code

Through this project, I have evolved in writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable and adaptable. The use of modular functions for distinct tasks such as loading data, inserting into the BST, and searching the tree, made the codebase more readable and easier to debug. Additionally, documenting the code and using meaningful variable names improved the overall clarity of the program.

In conclusion, this project provided valuable insights into the practical application of binary search trees and the importance of structured and maintainable code. The skills and knowledge gained will be beneficial for future software development projects and professional growth.
